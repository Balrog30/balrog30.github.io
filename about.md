My name is Nicholas Bering, and I live in Saint Catharines, Ontario. I've been interested in web and
software development as a hobby and passion since about grade 7, just before the first dot com boom.

I didn't pursue software development as a career out of school because I didn't want the cubicle life.
Obviously, things have changed a lot in the industry today, and am happy to have found a career where I
can particpate equally well without being chained to any particular desk. I switched from a career in
Agriculture to Software Development in Octover 2015, but have been developing software as part of my
job description since 2012.

## Freelance Strengths

I contribute best as a full-stack JavaScript developer. I can do a little bit of design, and have a subscrption
to Adobe CC for when I need graphical tools, but my strength is on the logical level more than the visual.

I work as a freelancer, and am comfortable working remote. I use the tools my clients are comfortable
with to communicate. Telephone, Email, Slack, Skype, Google Hangouts... Wherever you're comfortable - I can meet you there.

I work wherever the mood strikes me to be. I do some work from home, but I'm also a member of a local
coworking co-operative. It gives me a place to go work away from my wife and daughters, but there's
also other software developers there that I can occasionally bounce ideas off of when I need a second
opinion or am stuck on something.

I am good at self-managing, and while I am not generally a team manager, I can help keep a team on track
by identifying project risks. Having lived most of my life around business ownership and management in
one form or another, I have a keen understanding of business needs.

## Operations

I am equally comfortable programming, or running infrastructure for a project. Setup of virtual
machines and platform services on Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services has often been my
responsiblility. I've also setup processes for dev-test, continuous integration, and continuous
deployment scenarios using tools from a variety of solutions vendors.

I always start my project with the end in mind, so I generally build out basic deployment processes
and a staging environment as early in a project as is practical. This has the added benefit of
giving project stakeholders a live environment to try as soon as possible. I also maintain documentation as
a project evolves so that other team members can join at any time and quickly become productive.

## Open Source

I'm comfortable working in the open source ecosystem, raising issues and making pull requests. I have
occassionally found need to fix bugs or fill feature gaps in open source software for the benefit
of another project.

I have a good understanding of Open Source Licensing and what it means for your software project.

Open Source Projects I've contributed to:

* [Angular Google Chart](https://github.com/angular-google-chart/angular-google-chart/)

## Technologies

I've been working with computers for a long time, so I'm comfortable learning anything new required
to complete a project, using the best tool for the job. Here's just a sampling of technology I've worked
with to solve real business problems in the past:

* C# (.Net Framework)
* Regular Expressions
* SQL (PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server)
* ASP.Net Web API
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* AngularJS (1.x)
* Ionic Framework / Cordova
* NodeJS
* Gulp
* Grunt
* Electron
* HTML5
* CSS3
* SASS
* Eagle CAD
* Basic Digital and Analog Circuit Design
* Arduino
* Raspberry Pi
* Google Cast
* Ansible
* Ubuntu Linux
* Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Azure)
* HAProxy
* Zebra Printers (ZPL Label Design)
* Asterisk PBX

Ask me about any one of these, and there's probably and interesting story behind how I came to learn about
it. Technology is as much about people and life as it is about software and gadgets.
