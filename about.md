Welcome to my site! My blog represents a small subset of my interests. I am
generally fascinated with just about every kind of technology and engineering,
with my career being focused on Software Engineering.

Before transitioning into a technical career, I worked on my family's farm.
There, my main responsibilities were the tending of crops and managing of
agristourism and restaurant operations. I found value in coding custom software
for everything from agronomy and farm business management, to inventory planning.

[MedStack] invited me to join their team as the first full-time engineering hire
in 2017, starting as a Software Developer. So today I primarily focus on
compliance and security for startups handling protected health information. It's
a challenging ecosytem, and that makes it a lot of fun! The team has grown since
then - and so have I!

I'm currently a Technical Lead, and in 2022 our engineering team reached a
milestone of splitting into multiple teams. One team to address the primary
customer value stream, and another to address the complexity of fully-automated
cloud infrastructure operations.

My primary professional interests in the last 5 years include:
- DevOps culture
- Tools and practices in support of continuous deployment
- Public key infrastructure
- Cloud security operations
- Web application security
- Regulatory compliance for PII and PHI

I try not to take my work time into personal time (too much), but I still love
engineering in many forms. Some of my personal interests are:
- Space exploration systems
- Robotics
- 3D Printing
- Botany and Gardening
