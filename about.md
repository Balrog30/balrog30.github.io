Hi! My name is Nicholas Bering, and I'm a Staff Engineer at [MedStack]. I've been
with MedStack for the past 7 years, helping build a product from an idea, to
millions in annual revenue.

When I joined the team here in 2017, the technical team was just Simon Woodside
(the technical co-founder), and myself. The company quickly grew to about a
dozen people, and turned what we learned from providing a very manual service,
into an automated platform.

By 2023, the whole company numbered 25 people. And the engineering team reached
a milestone, by splitting into multiple teams. My title changed to Staff
Engineer, reflecting my role in coordinating technical projects, on-call
activities, and customer support for multiple teams.

I rarely write about work, given that our engagements with customers are often
confidential. But I do like to write about technology at large. I keep plenty of
side-projects to help expand my skills beyond work, and I'm always reading
something.
