            <p>
                Fail-safe systems are not necessarily designed to prevent a failure.
                They are designed to prevent the consquences of the failure from becoming
                dangerous or causing collateral damage.

            <p>
                FMEA is a formal analysis framework, used often by engineers of crticial systems
                such as flight systems. Considers:

            <ul>
                <li>Failure Mode</li>
                <li>Potential Causes</li>
                <li>Effects of Failure</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Locally</li>
                    <li>On Related Components</li>
                    <li>On the Entire System</li>

                After analyzing the effects of a possible failure, engineers would determine...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Probability of Failure</li>
                <li>Severity of Failure</li>
                <li>Ease of Detection</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Including the period in which it is likely to go undetected.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>
                This information is used to calculate the risk level as:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Probability &times; Severity + Detection</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Assessing risk in this way allows an engineering team to objectively
                score items to determine which potential failures receive priority.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>
                Risks that have been identified and scored will usually also have a documented
                plan or action and a procedure to help mitigate the risk. This might be something
                as simple as documenting the risk.

                Braking systems on trains work by using air pressure to release the
                brake while the train is in motion. If air pressure is lost, the
                brakes will automatically engage, bringing the train car to a stop.

                    The Emergency Brake on a car uses a cable instead of hydraulics to
                    engage the brake. It requires the driver to actively engage the
                    safety mechanism. This is also a type of redundancy.

                    before the collision they may not deploy.
