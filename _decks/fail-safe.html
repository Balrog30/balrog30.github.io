                Fail-safe systems are not necessarily designed to prevent a failure.
                tTey are designed to prevent the consquences of the failure from becoming
                dangerous or causing collateral damage.

                FMEA is a formal analysis framework, used often by engineers of crticial systems
                such as flight systems. Considers:

            <p>
                Braking systems on trains work by using air pressure to release the
                brake while the train is in motion. If air pressure is lost, the
                brakes will automatically engage, bringing the train car to a stop.
