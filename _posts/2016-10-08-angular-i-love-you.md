I haven't had an opportunity to work with AngularJS in a number of months, but
talking to a prospective client recently reminded me how much I love the
framework and the community.

## Makes Complex Things Simple

In addition to that client conversation, I've also been working on a client app
this month where AngularJS seemed like a bit of a heavy weight solution. The app
doesn't have very many pages. Client-side routing seemed undesirable from a
"keep it simple" stand-point. These and a few other design factors lead me to
build it purely in jQuery.

I have to admit, this was my first heavily interactive (if small) application
built with just jQuery. I probably could have done without jQuery, but we were
using bootstrap so jQuery was there already anyway. I quickly found that my
solution wasn't very well architected for this particular problem-space.
Specifically, I found myself writing a lot of extra code to handle state
transitions related to changes in the data model after Ajax requests completed.

I was trying to keep things simple by not using AngularJS, but in reality I
think I could have saved myself hours of development time and left a more
maintainable project if I had used a more structured framework. Did I need
AngularJS to do that? Maybe not. But Angular's structural pattern generally
helps developers "fall into the pit of success."

## Awesome Community

The community built up around AngularJS is just fantastically helpful. There are
a plethora of blog posts covering everything one might want to know about
application development with the framework. When I started working with it over
2 years ago, this was my first client-side web framework. I had a lot of
questions. I was never left short of answers, with everything from how to handle
token-based authentication, to how to write unit tests.

To the community: I miss you all, and I hope I can get some work building apps
along with you again.

The AngularJS community kind of feels like the Co-working space I work out of
here in Saint Catharines. No one is working specifically on the same project,
but everyone provides support for one another anyway. They're not actually
pitching in on the work necessarily, but just being there and talking to
each other makes us feel less alone.

If you have remote work available with AngularJS 1.x, I'd love to work with you.
See my [Hire Me](/hire/) page for more information. I'm willing to learn
Angular 2.0 as well.
