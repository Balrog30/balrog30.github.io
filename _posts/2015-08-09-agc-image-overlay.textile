p. As promised in my last post, I did something slightly designery as something for show-and-tell at CodePenTo next Wednesday. Also, I'd like to note that this is my first post with pretty pictures.  Enjoy!

h2. Image Overlays

p. I first stumbled upon this feature trying to replicate the annotation feature available in Google Analytics. At first glance I thought they were just dressed-up chart annotations.  The name is the same after all, right?

p(image-frame). !(test){{ site.baseurl }}/images/analytics-annotations-screenshot.png(Google Analytics Annotations)! *Fig. 1* Annotations in Google Analytics turn out not to use Google Charts Annotations.

p. It turns out there was no way to make an annotation look quite like the feature I was looking for. But that's okay, there is still a fairly straight-forward way to do it. And I'll even save you from 2 hours of head-scratching that I did.

p. There is a set of examples on how to do this without AngularJS in the "(tracked). Charts API Documentation":1.

h2. Chart Layout Interface

p. The basic mechanism provided by the Charts API to accomplish this task is the Chart Layout Interface. It is accessible on supported charts by calling @getChartLayoutInterface()@. This is called on the actual chart instance, which you can get in angular-google-chart by implementing an @on-ready@ handler to retrieve the ChartWrapper instance, and then getting the chart instance from that.

{% highlight javascript %}
(function(){
  angular.module('chart-example')
    .controller('ExampleController', ExampleController);

  ExampleController.$inject = ['$scope', 'chartObject'];

  function ExampleController($scope, chartObject){
  
    $scope.readyHandler = function (chartWrapper) {
	  var chart, layoutInterface;
	  chart = chartWrapper.getChart();
	  layoutInterface = chart.getChartLayoutInterface();
	};
	
	// Chart Object added with Dependency Injection
	// Convenient for examples.
	$scope.chart = chartObject;
  }
})();
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html %}
<!-- Important Note: chartWrapper is injected by name here, so spell it correctly. -->
<div google-chart chart="chart" on-ready="readyHandler(chartWrapper)"></div>
{% endhighlight %}

p. So what does this layoutInterface do for us? Basically, it allows us to retrieve pixel coordinates for positions relative to the actual chart data. In the Google Analytics example, the x-axis is a date type. So in that case you could use the layoutInterface to take a given date, and get the x-coordinates of that date in the chart area.

p. The layoutInterface API works something like this...

{% highlight javascript %}
var layoutInterface = chartWrapper.getChart().getChartLayoutInterface();

// Get the X location of February 13, 2015
var x = layoutInterface.getXLocation(new Date(2015,1,13));

// Get the Y location of the value 175
var y = layoutInterface.getYLocation(175);

// setup css values to position an element at those coords with ng-style
var style = {
  position: 'absolute',
  left: x + 'px',
  top: y + 'px'
}
{% endhighlight %}

You can also work the other way around.  Let's say we have some kind of pointer event with an x and y value.  We can work backwards from that the get the chart data values for those coordinates.

{% highlight javascript %}
var hValue = layoutInterface.getHAxisValue(x);
var vValue = layoutInterface.getVAxisValue(y);
{% endhighlight %}

The layoutInterface also has methods for getting boundings boxes of the entire chart, and for the chart area.

h2. All Together Now

p. Here's my example, on CodePen for the first time ever. It's kind of subtle, but the weather icons on the top of the chart are taken from a column in the chart's DataTable. When the chart is ready, an array of objects with the necessary information to render the images in place is created from the chart data. An @ng-repeat@ inside the same container element as the chart directive renders the actual image tags.

<p data-height="489" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="yNZxKr" data-default-tab="result" data-user="Balrog30" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/nbering/pen/yNZxKr/'>Angular-Google-Chart Image Overlay</a> by Nicholas Bering (<a href='http://codepen.io/nbering'>@Balrog30</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

h2. Gotcha!

p. I wasted a couple of hours trying to get everything to render in the right location. The x and y values returned by the layout interface are relative to the chart's container element. But that doesn't necessarily mean your css absolute values will be rendered from the same reference point. Make sure the element above the chart directive has @position: relative;@. This will force the browser to use that element as the reference point when rendering your overlay.
