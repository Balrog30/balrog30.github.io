I'm getting excited for [CodePenTo], coming Wednesday, August 12, 2015 in
Toronto. This will be my first tech industry event, so I thought I'd tackle a
mini-project. I think I'll stick with my usual subject-matter -
[Angular-Google-Chart][angular-google-chart]. But since this is a front-end
focused crowd - at least I think they are - I'm going to work on something a
little more designer-y. I don't have much of a design focus, or skill-set,
myself. So wish me luck.

The mini-project goal is to build a Google Chart with graphics overlaid onto the
chart area. I've done this before for a work project, but it was kind of a hack.
Now that I know how to make this work, I'll try to clean it up and make it more
generic so that it can serve as an example project. I think I'll make this one
Maple. Because... why not?

In honour of the event sponsor - CodePen.io[CodePen] - I will be building this
example in CodePen.  I've never used their service, so this will be a first. I
signed up already and the project's very first building blocks are in place -
nothing to see yet, but it's started. You can [check it out now][Project], if
you want to follow my progress.

I have been listening to the CodePen founders' [Podcast] for a few months now,
and have enjoyed some bits of insight from an operating startup SaaS.

I actually discovered CodePenTo because I follow the event's other sponsor,
[Rangle.io], on twitter.  I stumbled across Rangle.io on [Stack Overflow Careers]
[Careers Post],and was very impressed by their employee value proposition. From
the outside the seem to have a very strong, forward-thinking company culture.
The team looks to be very diverse, and with a focus on continuously learning,
and teaching. Were I looking for a job right now, Rangle would be the first
place I applied to.

As an aside, I'm also thinking of putting some effort into the design of this
site. This is a currently a very blah setup, and I was thinking of adding a bit
of colour and a few graphics.
