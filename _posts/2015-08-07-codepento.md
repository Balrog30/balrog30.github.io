I'm getting excited for <a href="https://nvite.com/CodePenTo/e92c">CodePenTo</a>, coming Wednesday, August 12, 2015 in Toronto. This will be my first tech industry event, so I thought I'd tackle a mini-project. I think I'll stick with my usual subject-matter - <a href="https://github.com/angular-google-chart/angular-google-chart/">Angular-Google-Chart</a>. But since this is a front-end focused crowd - at least I think they are - I'm going to work on something a little more designery. I don't have much of a design focus or skillset myself though, so wish me luck.

The mini-project goal is to build a Google Chart with graphics overlayed onto the chart area. I've done this before for a work project, but it was kind of a hack. Now that I know how to make this work, I'll try to clean it up and make it more generic so that it can serve as an example project. I think I'll make this one Maple. Because... why not?

In honour of the event sponsor - <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen.io</a> - I will be building this example in CodePen.  I've never use their service, so this will be a first. I signed up already and the project's very first building blocks are in place - nothing to see yet, but it's started. You can <a href="http://codepen.io/Balrog30/pen/yNZxKr">check it out now</a>, if you want to follow my progress.

I have been listening to the CodePen founders' <a href="http://blog.codepen.io/radio/">Podcast</a> for a few months now, and have enjoyed some bits of insight from an operating startup SaaS.

I actually discovered CodePenTo because I follow the event's other sponsor, <a href="http://rangle.io/">Rangle.io</a>, on twitter.  I stumbled across Rangle.io on <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/company/rangle-io">Stack Overflow Careers</a>, and was very impressed by their employee value proposition. From the outside the seem to have a very strong, forward-thinking company culture. The team looks to be very diverse, and with a focus on continuously learning, and teaching. Were I looking for a job right now, Rangle would be the first place I applied to.

As an aside, I'm also thinking of putting some effort into the design of this site. This is a currently a very blah setup, and I was thinking of adding a bit of colour and a few graphics.
