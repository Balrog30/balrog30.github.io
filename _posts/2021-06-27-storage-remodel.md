title: Small Storage System Remodel
description: >
    A while back, I found this excellent screw storage system on Thingiverse, 
    but I wanted it to have a locking closure. So I remodelled it in OnShape and
    customized it for my use.

A little while ago, I bought a large order of screws to have as inventory.
I was tired of looking at the hardware store to find that they didn't have
the metric sizes I wanted, so I stocked up.

The local supplier I use shipped me everything as a sealed bag in a cardboard
box for each size. So I needed a better way to store my screws. I looked around
on Amazon and found that quality storage was costly, and cheap storage
was just that: cheap.

Since I have a 3D printer, I turned to Thingiverse to see if there was already
a solution I could use. I found this excellent [screw storage solution][1] by
Thingiverse user [CaptainObvious][2].

It met my needs perfectly, except for one tiny detail: the outer boxes didn't
stay closed well with too much weight. Before I even loaded the boxes, I had a
minor spill when one of the boxes slipped. I would have preferred that it stayed
closed if dropped or tilted, but it made trade-offs to print without supports
that weakened the closure.

This project took me about a month of off-and-on work to complete, but I'm
pretty happy with the result. The original designer hadn't included the CAD
files for the project. So I had to import the original STL, measure it, and
reverse-engineer a design of my own.

<p class="image-frame"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/storage-remodel-03_big.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/storage-remodel-03_small.png" alt="My reverse-engineered CAD design."></a> My reverse-engineered CAD design.</p>

Once I had a design that was close to the original - and most importantly,
compatible with the original system's bins - I added my custom slide-locking
mechanism.

The slide-lock itself is composed of a pair of dovetail-like rails, with a piece
that slides along them.

<p class="image-frame"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/storage-remodel-04_big.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/storage-remodel-04_small.png" alt="Slide-lock design render in OnShape."></a> Slide-lock design render in OnShape.</p>

I spent some time thinking about how to keep the slider locked to the box once
installed. I came up with some complicated ideas that included clip-together
parts, screws, or glue. In the end, I decided it wasn't worth the complexity.
The slider can fall off the rail if the box is open - but is easy to
replace if it does.

I may add my remixed version to Thingiverse for others to use, but I think it
still needs some work. The rails for the slide-lock tend to have some cosmetic
issues when printed. I think it might help if they were a little bigger. But to
achieve that, I may need to change the proportions of the lid and box. That
would allow more room on the lid for a wider rail.
