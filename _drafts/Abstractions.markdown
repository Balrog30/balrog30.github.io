One of the things I've always loved about working with computers lies in the
very nature of abstraction.  I just love how I can use something, with very
little upfront understanding, but then as I use it more I can dig deeper and do
more amazing things.

I must admit, my first encounter with the word Abstract in a programming context
was not pleasant.  I was in grade 12 programming and we finally got to learn a
"useful" language (Java).  Java has an `Abstract` keyword, and I was mostly
learning on my own, so I didn't understand what it meant.  Abstract classes were
very frustrating to me at the time.  I was trying to set up an applet that used
2D Graphics, and the API Documentation had all these classes that I wanted to use,
but couldn't, because they were just Abstract Base classes for something that did
actually do something.

So that got me off to a rocky start with the concept of "Abstract".  But over the
years, I've learned a different meaning of the word.  The car analogy is great
here.  I could drive a car without understanding a thing about Engines, or the
chemistry of Gasoline.  All I needed to know was move this stick to tell the car
to move forward, backward or stay still.  Push this pedal to go, and this one to
stop.  Turn the wheel in the direction you want to travel.

But when things go wrong, you need to dig a little deeper, and peel back some of
the layers of abstraction.  What happens if the car won't start?  Is it the Battery?
Is it the Starter?  What's wrong with the Starter?  How does a Starter work, anyway?

I absolutely love peeling back the layers like that, in any topic.  I spent the
last few years learning to grow field crops before we decided to focus the business
on Maple Syrup.  I had a lot to catch up on since I spent my High School years
studying computers programming and electronics.  But I found similarities even
in studying the field of Agronomy.  "This path of the field looks yellower than
the field around it.  Is there something wrong with the soil?  Are there bugs
feeding on the plant?  How do I identify the bugs?  What do I do about them?"

But you don't need to know about N-P-K values for fertilizer to plant a seed and
watch it grow.  That extra knowledge just helps grow bigger, greener, more productive
plants.  The same goes for computer programming.  I didn't need to understand
TCP, HTTP or any other Networking protocols to make a Web Site with HTML when I was
11 years old.  But understanding more helps me make better solutions, and solve
more complex problems.
